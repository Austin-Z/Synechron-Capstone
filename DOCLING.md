## Installation

To use Docling, simply install `docling` from your package manager, e.g. pip:
```bash
pip install docling
```

Works on macOS, Linux and Windows environments. Both x86_64 and arm64 architectures.

More [detailed installation instructions](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/installation/) are available in the docs.

## Getting started

To convert individual documents with python, use `convert()`, for example:

```python
from docling.document_converter import DocumentConverter

source = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.09869"  # document per local path or URL
converter = DocumentConverter()
result = converter.convert(source)
print(result.document.export_to_markdown())  # output: "## Docling Technical Report[...]"
```

More [advanced usage options](https://docling-project.github.io/docling/usage/) are available in
the docs.

## CLI

Docling has a built-in CLI to run conversions.

```bash
docling https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01062
```

You can also use 🥚[SmolDocling](https://huggingface.co/ds4sd/SmolDocling-256M-preview) and other VLMs via Docling CLI:
```bash
docling --pipeline vlm --vlm-model smoldocling https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01062
```
This will use MLX acceleration on supported Apple Silicon hardware.
